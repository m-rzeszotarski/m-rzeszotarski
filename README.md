# My Python Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋 I'm Michał, a biotechnologist with a knack for analytical thinking and a newfound love for Python programming. This README is a glimpse into my exciting adventure as I dive into the world of code.

## Current Status:
🐍 **Learning Python:** Currently, I'm in the process of mastering Python. From the basics to the more intricate aspects. I'm currently writting a beer rating app, the mystical link to which can be unearthed in the treasure trove of my profile.

## Aspirations:
🔍 **Exploring the Database Realm:** My next conquest is to conquer the vast lands of databases, with SQL as my trusty sword. I'm ready to tame the data dragons and unlock the secrets they hold.

## The Biotechnologist Turned Coder:
🧪 **From Petri Dishes to Pixels:** As a biotechnologist, I've always enjoyed the thrill of problem-solving in the lab. Now, I've decided to trade in my lab coat for a coding cape. Programming has become my new laboratory, and bugs are the mysterious organisms I'm determined to understand.

## Why Programming? Because...
🤖 **Finding Solutions in Code:** There's something oddly satisfying about troubleshooting errors and making things work. It's like solving puzzles, but the pieces are lines of code, and the picture is a functional program. Who knew debugging could be so entertaining?

## Fun Facts:
🚀 **Launching into a New Career Path:** I'm on a mission to switch my career path. Biotechnology, it's been real, but coding has called, and I must answer!

## Let's Connect:
🌐 **Open to Collaboration:** If you're on a similar journey or a seasoned coding wizard, let's connect! I'm open to collaborations, advice, and maybe a few programming jokes to lighten the debugging mood.

Thanks for stopping by, and may your code be as bug-free as a well-maintained bioreactor! 🧬💻
